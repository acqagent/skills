# Acquisition Policy written-product specification

## Scope header

The scope header (title-block metadata) of every product must carry, verbatim from intake:

- **Prepared for:** the customer organization that requested the analysis. Never substitute the analyzed agency, another agency, or an invented organization.
- **Decision date:** the customer's decision date. The analyzed agency and as-of date are separate fields and do not satisfy this requirement.
- **Prior analysis** (refresh route only): the title and date of the prior analysis being refreshed.

The record validator errors when the record's scope block lacks `customer_organization` or `decision_date`, and, for the refresh route, when `scope.prior_analysis` lacks a title and date. The DOCX validator confirms these values appear in the rendered product.

## Illustrative data labeling

When a product is built from illustrative rather than live-sourced data, use the standard reader-facing label **"Illustrative example (not live data)"** and place it only in the limitations or evidence-status block. Never place that label, or any test-harness vocabulary ("test record", "test fixture", "synthetic", "fixture"), inside payload tables, findings, timelines, or other reader-visible content. The record validator rejects reader-visible fields containing test-harness vocabulary.

## Route-specific written products

Use a distinct product name and lead form for each route. The first page states the policy question, as-of date, governing source layers, documented status, practical acquisition impact, key uncertainty, and next responsible action. Keep evidence in an appendix or source note, not in the opening view.

| Route | Product | Lead form |
|---|---|---|
| Current text | Current Rule Explanation | annotated rule card |
| Agency status | Agency Policy Status Matrix | status dashboard and confirmation list |
| Three-layer comparison | Three-Layer Policy Comparison | comparison table and adoption test |
| Change comparison | Regulatory Change Briefing | before/after change map |
| Rulemaking | Rulemaking Timeline | dated milestone sequence |
| Comment periods | Open Rulemaking Watchlist | deadline watchlist |
| Comments | Public Comment Position Analysis | sample-method panel and theme map |
| Refresh | Policy Analysis Refresh | change log and carry-forward decisions |

The product name is a substantive promise, not merely a heading:

- A Current Rule Explanation requires a concise rule card that separates the codified baseline from non-operative comparison layers and tells the acquisition team which source to use now.
- An Agency Policy Status Matrix requires a named-agency adoption view, comparator treatment, and a confirmation list; it must not repeat a government-wide rule explanation as its main body.
- A Three-Layer Policy Comparison requires a side-by-side codified/model/agency-deviation map and an adoption test; it must not reuse the Agency Status or Current Rule body.
- A Regulatory Change Briefing requires matched before-and-after text, a clause- or section-level delta, operational consequences, and reader-facing source citations.
- A Rulemaking Timeline requires a dated milestone sequence, current stage, next status-changing trigger, and monitoring owner; it must not repeat a general current-status report.
- An Open Rulemaking Watchlist requires live matter or docket identifiers, stage, verified deadline or an explicit no-open-window result, next event, owner, and recommended action.
- A Public Comment Position Analysis requires an approved sample frame, returned and reviewed counts, stakeholder segments, coded themes, contrary positions, limitations, and acquisition implications.
- A Policy Analysis Refresh requires a dated prior baseline, current retrievals, changed and unchanged conclusions, consequences, and refresh actions.

If the approved record lacks the evidence that makes the selected product useful, provide a short evidence-acquisition note in chat. Do not turn an evidence gap into a six-page report that resembles a completed analysis.

Each route must stop after its route-native analysis, management actions, focused source notes, and limitations. Do not append the generic Impact Brief body to Current Rule, Agency Status, Three-Layer, Change Comparison, Rulemaking, Comment Period, Public Comment, or Refresh products. The full twelve-section structure is reserved for the Acquisition Policy Impact Brief.

### Per-route required payload and the shared-framing cap

Each route's required payload sections are:

| Route | Required payload sections |
|---|---|
| Current Rule Explanation | Current Rule Card |
| Agency Policy Status Matrix | Agency Adoption Status table |
| Three-Layer Policy Comparison | Three-Layer Comparison and Adoption Test table |
| Regulatory Change Briefing | Before/After Change Map; Implementation decisions |
| Rulemaking Timeline | Rulemaking Milestones and Next Trigger table |
| Open Rulemaking Watchlist | Watchlist table; Response priorities |
| Public Comment Position Analysis | Comment Sample and Theme Coverage; Coded themes table |
| Policy Analysis Refresh | Refresh Change Register; Carry-forward decisions |

The route-specific analysis, findings, and implications must be the majority of the document body. Shared framing common to all routes is limited to the scope header, the evidence register or source notes, and the limitations block. Do not repeat a table's rows in a second section; when a second section would emit identical rows, replace it with a one-line cross-reference. Two products from different routes on the same record must differ in the majority of their body content, not by one table alone; where the builder would otherwise inject fixed framing regardless of route, that framing must be record-driven or route-conditional.

## Product-first reader contract

Every written product must lead with the operational meaning of the approved evidence, not a recap of the request or a research-process summary. Before the detailed source sections, the opening view must provide:

1. **Planning posture:** a plain-English posture such as proceed from the codified baseline, implement within documented agency scope, monitor pending rulemaking, or hold a disputed implementation point for authorized resolution.
2. **Immediate implications:** what the posture changes for acquisition planning, solicitation timing, file support, industry communication, or monitoring. Use only implications supported by the approved findings.
3. **Owners and decision gates:** identify who must supply the next decision-ready evidence and when it is needed. Prefer roles such as policy office, contracting officer, counsel, program office, or policy analyst over vague next steps.
4. **Planning scenarios:** show how the treatment changes if the baseline holds, agency adoption is confirmed, rulemaking changes status, or a material conflict remains unresolved. Include only scenarios relevant to the route and record.
5. **Proportionate boundary:** reserve legal advice, procurement-specific applicability, deviation approval, and other official determinations in a compact note. Do not let boundary language displace the practical answer.

When the approved record supplies `validation.planning_posture`, `validation.decision_gates`, or `validation.planning_scenarios`, use those approved fields. When it does not, give the supported posture and material unknowns without fabricating a generic gate structure. Never invent an agency adoption, effective date, controlling value, owner commitment, procurement fact, or meeting cadence to make the product appear decisive.

## Impact Brief content functions

A full Acquisition Policy Impact Brief should cover the supported functions below, but the author chooses their order, grouping, and labels. Omit empty or immaterial functions and combine closely related ones. Never manufacture owners, scenarios, timelines, or deadlines merely to complete an outline.

- Planning posture, practical implications, and question scope
- Documented current status, source hierarchy, and authorities
- Material scenarios, changes, impacts, and open issues
- Owners or decision gates only when supported by the approved record
- A concise Source Register
- One proportionate limitations and reserved-determinations note

Use the `standard_business_brief` visual preset with a restrained memo masthead. Use US Letter portrait, one-inch margins, Calibri 11-point body text, blue heading hierarchy, quiet running header/footer, real list styles, and fixed-width tables with repeating header rows.

The title block states the agency or scope, as-of date, audience lens, and preparation status. Do not call the brief a legal opinion, authoritative policy determination, or contract-file approval.

## Documented-status vocabulary

Status cells in the Agency Policy Status Matrix ("Status for this question" column) and the Three-Layer Comparison ("Documented status" column) must use only the allowed value for the row's layer type. An agency name is never a documented status.

| Layer type | Allowed status value |
|---|---|
| Codified current text; effective final rule | Government-wide baseline (matrix) or Codified current baseline (three-layer) |
| FAR Council model deviation text | Published model text; not agency-operative (matrix) or Published model text; not operative alone (three-layer) |
| Proposed rule | Pending rulemaking; not current policy |
| Final rule pending effective date | Final rule pending effective date; not current policy |
| Withdrawn rule | Withdrawn; not current policy |
| Superseded issuance | Superseded; not current policy |
| Nonregulatory guidance | Guidance; not regulation |
| Agency class deviation (three-layer) | Agency class deviation |
| Agency class deviation issued by the named agency (matrix) | Named-agency evidence |
| Agency class deviation issued by another agency (matrix) | Comparator only; does not establish adoption for the named agency |

A proposed-rule or deviation row must never carry the codified-baseline status. The DOCX validator errors on any status cell outside this vocabulary and on any non-baseline layer labeled with the codified-baseline status.

## Source presentation

- Put reader-facing source markers such as `[S1]` or `[S1, S4]` beside every consequential finding and impact statement. Never expose internal `E001`-style identifiers.
- Number sources by first appearance and preserve canonical public hyperlinks in a concise Source Register.
- Keep codified text, agency deviations, model text, rulemaking, guidance, and public comments visually distinguishable.
- Use tables only for repeated comparable records such as policy layers, timelines, and the evidence register.
- Do not place internal prompts, tool names, filesystem paths, credentials, or raw private text in the document.

## Impacts

Government and industry lenses use the same evidence. They may differ only in operational framing:

- Government: acquisition planning, solicitation timing, internal policy confirmation, transition treatment, and file documentation.
- Industry: solicitation interpretation questions, proposal assumptions, compliance planning, timing, and monitoring.
- Neutral: both lenses without advocacy.

Impacts are considerations, not directives or legal conclusions.

## Validation

The builder requires `validation.findings_approved` and `validation.brief_approved` to be true. The validator checks route-native outcome coverage, reader-facing source-marker resolution, live hyperlinks, as-of date, decision-boundary language, table geometry, prohibited internal content, and policy-record validity. It must not require one exact heading list or section order when another coherent form satisfies the route.

Validation is a floor, not the release decision. After validation, convert the DOCX through LibreOffice, extract text, confirm live links, render every page, and inspect the rendered product as the intended reader. Reject and revise any output whose first page does not answer what the reader should do, whose tables crowd or clip, whose boundaries overwhelm the recommendation, or whose owners and scenarios are too generic to use. Repeat validation and rendering after each material revision.
